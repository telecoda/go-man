go-man
======

Pacman type game built as a RESTful API using go-lang

This project is my first venture into using go.

- A. I normally spend my day developing API's in java / python.

- B. I normally spend my commute time trying to throw together some game code for fun.

- A + B = C. Here is my playground project to learn about the go language and have a little fun at the same time.

Inspired by the idea of https://speakerdeck.com/christkv/mongoman-a-nodejs-powered-pacman-clone I saw demoed at

2012 MongoDB conference in London.
